# 🤔 DyoGrid

## Open-source Platform for LLM Agents

**DyoGrid** is an open-source, modular platform for orchestrating teams of intelligent agents powered by large language models. It lets you build agent-based workflows that integrate with your existing systems—ERPs, CRMs, databases and IoT platforms—with full governance, observability and extensibility.

### 🚨 The Problem

- **Shadow AI** – isolated experiments create duplication and security gaps.
- **Integration Pain** – connecting LLMs to enterprise systems takes weeks of brittle code.
- **Vendor Lock-In** – proprietary platforms limit flexibility and control.
- **No Observability** – poor insight into agent behavior, cost and outcome quality.

### ✅ The DyoGrid Solution

- **Agent Fabric** – pluggable LLM agent modules compatible with Autogen-style interactions.
- **Team Orchestrator** – DAG-style coordination with retry logic, stop rules and budget caps.
- **Integration Mesh** – connectors and SDKs for REST, databases, Kafka, RPA and more.
- **Governance Layer** – RBAC, telemetry, cost metering and traceability.
- **Developer UX** – visual flows via low-code canvas or advanced scripting via SDK/CLI.
